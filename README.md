# Cat's ESP + Aimbot System

A sleek, real-time **ESP + Aimbot** system for Roblox built for precision and performance.

## Features

- **Aimbot Targeting**  
  Always aims at the **enemy's head** — even if they are **above or below** you. No more horizontal-only lock-on limits.

- **Automatic ESP System**  
  Displays all players’ names and live distance in studs above their heads. Tracks joins/leaves automatically.

- **Clean Esp UI**  
  Non-intrusive, always-on-top GUI with clear, smooth-scaled labels.

- **Standalone Script**  
  Fully local. Doesn’t rely on any external modules or assets.

## How It Works

- Continuously scans for the closest enemy player within a defined radius.
- Locks your camera directly to their **head position** every frame.
- Updates ESP for all players (excluding yourself) with live distance tracking.

- have fun! :)
